# Odin Project Landing Page

Hi, here is my solution to the Landing Page project from Odin project.
I've dedicated this site to one of my favorite football player, Sir Sunil Chhetri.

This challenge helped me to learn more about flexbox and how it can be used to build responsive site without any media queries.

I've taken the BEM approach to name my classes, which helped greatly to organize and maintain my code easily.
